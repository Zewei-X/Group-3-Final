1,Is America’s jobs market nearing a cliff?,,2025-11-30T15:27:52.353Z,"Everyone is gloomy about America’s jobs market. Investors talk of a “K-shaped” economy, in which growth is buoyed by an exuberant stockmarket and artificial-intelligence investment, while ordinary Americans languish. Job creation and overall economic growth, which usually move in tandem, have diverged. The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates at its two most recent meetings. Jerome Powell, the central bank’s chair, calls the loosening “risk management”, or insurance against a deeper downturn. Christopher Waller, a contender to replace Mr Powell, is pushing for further and faster cuts, beginning at the next meeting on December 10th, to support a weakening jobs market.",https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/11/30/is-americas-jobs-market-nearing-a-cliff,economy
2,This bodge-it budget does not give Britain what it needs,,2025-11-26T21:55:13.704Z,"BRITAIN IS in alarming decline. Its paltry productivity growth, high borrowing costs and incoherent economic policy are bad enough. But the country also risks the collapse of the political centre ground. The combined polling share of the populist-right Reform UK and populist-left Green parties now exceeds that of the Labour and Conservative Parties, the duopoly that has dominated British politics for over a century.",https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/11/26/this-bodge-it-budget-does-not-give-britain-what-it-needs,economy
3,Britain’s budget prioritised Labour's political survival,,2025-11-26T20:17:50.230Z,"Britain’s chancellor devoted much of her budget speech to lambasting the previous government. “The Conservatives crashed the economy,” thundered Rachel Reeves, accusing them of “time and time again” ducking “necessary reforms”. Labour, she insisted, is different: it is prepared to make the choices needed to revive growth. Sir Keir Starmer has similarly clothed his actions in the language of service. “Country first, party second”, he reminded Labour Party members in 2024. “That isn’t a slogan. It’s the foundation of this project.”",https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/11/26/britains-budget-prioritised-labours-political-survival,economy

As chancellor, these charges could equally apply to her today. The run-up to the budget on November 26th has been sea-sickening even for those with the sturdiest stomachs. Since the summer the government has floated a dizzying array of possible tax rises, only to reverse course on many. Most strikingly, Ms Reeves hinted that she might break a manifesto pledge not to increase income-tax rates—but then backtracked a mere ten days later.

Its economy, once dependent on breeding horses, pivoted into sifting gold then refining oil. Now it relies on attracting tourists to its white beaches, 24-hour casinos and daily games of bingo. An island just 32km long would not seem to have many bragging rights over the world’s second-biggest economy. But tiny Aruba has achieved something China’s leaders would dearly love to emulate.

Just as extraordinary, but much less appreciated, is its towering current-account surplus, the result not just of a trade boom but of a long-undervalued currency.

It is on a roll, but risks a messy correction.

Growth would be “Labour’s obsession”, promised Sir Keir Starmer, when he was still in opposition. Britain was poor, the Labour leader argued, because it had been governed chaotically and had forgotten how to build anything. But two remedies—sensible management and reform of its sclerotic planning system—would unleash a building boom. And, conveniently, bullishness on growth also seemed to offer a way out of Britain’s fiscal mess that did not involve raising taxes.

FOR YEARS the world economy has defied doomsayers. When the coronavirus pandemic struck, many people expected a long slump; instead there was a fast and inflationary rebound. When central banks then raised interest rates to quell prices, a widely forecasted recession never came. And after President Donald Trump slapped “Liberation Day” tariffs on trading partners in April, markets tanked. Investors feared an enormous trade war and a deep crisis.

140,How to get a free meal in China,,2024-12-19T10:49:39.619Z,"Listen to this story
Your browser does not support the <audio> element.
CHINESE PANCAKES, pepper-beef stir-fry, fish with pickled mustard greens: to the average diner in China, these must sound like normal food orders. But to the staff at some restaurants they represent something else. These are code words that customers can use to signal that they would like a free meal. Such charitable schemes are becoming more common, as the Chinese economy sags. And restaurant owners report that an increasing number of people are using the code words.
Huang Ming has offered free bowls of noodles or dumplings since he opened his restaurant in the south-western city of Chengdu eight years ago. Back then, he says, only a few free bowls were claimed each month. Now his restaurant hands out dozens, usually to people in their 20s and 30s, says Mr Huang. China’s youth-unemployment rate has been over 16% since July.
Most of the restaurant owners offering free meals appear motivated by compassion. Mr Huang recalls his own experience nearly a decade ago. Hungry and struggling, he walked into a restaurant he could not afford and left with a full stomach. The cost of such kindness tends to be manageable. And today there is also a marketing benefit. Users of Dianping, a restaurant-review app, and Xiaohongshu, China’s answer to Instagram, share photos of signs advertising free meals. Commenters often vow to frequent benevolent eateries.
Most people in China do not need a free meal, but many are spending less on food. Young people are going to canteens for senior citizens, where they can buy tasty dishes at discounted prices. Cheap food courts beneath malls and office buildings have become lively lunch spots. Some eateries promote inexpensive options called “poor man’s meals”. Users of delivery platforms are making their orders more affordable by choosing an option that allows them to share costs with other users nearby.
The food industry, like other sectors of the economy, has suffered from the public’s thriftiness. National restaurant chains report lower average spending per customer. Beijing’s big food and beverage companies saw their profits fall by 88.8% year on year in the first half of 2024, according to city statistics. Mr Huang says his restaurant may have to close because of declining revenues. That danger will not stop him from offering free meals, though.■

Meanwhile the number of people over 60 is expected to grow from 300m in 2023 to more than 400m by 2035—that is, from one-fifth to nearly one-third of the population.

By Leo Mirani, Asia correspondent, The Economist
Upon taking office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Narendra Modi immediately boosted infrastructure spending. Many state and local governments followed suit. The country desperately needed it. Urban infrastructure has endured years of neglect even as cities expanded in size and population.
Nowhere is this more so than Mumbai, the commercial capital. Home to 22m people, India’s richest city had long been an embarrassment, with gridlocked roads, packed trains and an airport at capacity. In 2025 some of the city’s new infrastructure projects will, at last, be complete.
Perhaps the most eagerly awaited will be the opening of new metro lines. One that will connect the city’s southern tip to other business districts and the airport is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2025. It will be Mumbai’s first mass-transit link to the existing airport.
Another much-anticipated project is a coastal road running along the city’s west coast, part of which opened in 2024. The plan is to use the road, built on reclaimed land, to link the west with a bridge on the east of the city, in turn connecting the Mumbai peninsula to the mainland. The 10km road will be completed in 2025, with 175 acres of new parks and seaside promenades alongside it.
Arguably the most impressive infrastructure project to open in 2025 will be a vast new airport on the city’s outskirts. Mumbai’s existing airport has just one usable runway and is in the middle of the city.
The completion of these megaprojects will build upon a spate of ribbon-cuttings in 2024. More are on the way, including a high-speed rail link to Ahmedabad, an economic hub, and a motorway to Delhi, the capital.
To pay for all this, and similar projects across the country, India has in recent years turbocharged public investment. A record 11trn rupees ($130bn), or 3.4% of gdp, has been set aside for infrastructure in the year to the end of March 2025, three times the annual amount of a decade ago. Much more spending and building will be necessary to expand India’s economy and boost the living standards of its people. But the pace is picking up. ■",https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2024/11/20/mumbais-infrastructure-extravaganza-will-soon-be-revealed,economy
161,Will private firms step up to maintain India’s investment splurge?,,2024-11-20T09:25:03.725Z,"By Simon Cox, China economics editor, The Economist
Narendra Modi, India’s 15th prime minister, is no great fan of the first person to do the job. Jawaharlal Nehru, who led India from its independence in 1947 until his death in 1964, was an urbane socialist who once wrote that the spectacle of organised religion filled him with horror. To him, “the temples of modern India” were dams and other marvels of infrastructure. All of this is antithetical to Mr Modi, a Hindu nationalist who revels in religious showmanship. But in their approach to the Indian economy, the two prime ministers share a striking similarity: a heavy reliance on public investment.",https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2024/11/20/will-private-firms-step-up-to-maintain-indias-investment-splurge,economy

By the close of 2023 Argentina was teetering on the edge of a precipice, beset by a confluence of economic ills reminiscent of its most harrowing crises. The monetary overhang had ballooned to twice the level of 1975, which triggered the infamous Rodrigazo, an inflationary spiral that ushered in five decades of stagnation. The central bank’s interest-bearing liabilities had swelled to four times the monetary base, surpassing even the ratio of 1989 that precipitated hyperinflation. By the year’s end GDP was in free fall after 15 years of stagnation.

France, which had not balanced a government budget since 1974, would fix its public finances and restore its credibility with its thrifty neighbour. In return, Germany, the euro zone’s biggest economy, would cede ground on French ideas for European integration, such as joint borrowing. Initially the bargain worked.

For much of the 20th century it was a home to heavy industry. By the 1960s it was exporting more coal than anywhere else in Europe and had built the Royal Navy’s first aircraft-carrier. In the 1970s it was importing the raw materials needed by the smelting furnace a short train ride away.

As Israeli families prepared to ring in the year 5785 on the evening of October 2nd, many must have hoped that it would at least be less bitter than 5784, which began with an atrocity. On October 7th 2023 Hamas, a militant Palestinian movement based in Gaza, burst through barriers walling Gaza off from Israel, massacred more than 1,100 people and took a further 250 hostage. During the year that has followed, Israel has not only fought non-stop with Hamas in Gaza, but also exchanged rockets with Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. As the year drew to an end, on September 30th, it sent troops across the border into Lebanon, to battle Hizbullah, a Lebanese militia that has been bombarding northern Israel. The next day Iran, a patron of both Hamas and Hizbullah, launched a salvo of 181 missiles at Israel. As The Economist went to press, the region was awaiting the inevitable Israeli riposte.

CPI inflation slowed in August to 2.5% year-on-year. But when America’s central bankers meet on September 17th to discuss cutting interest rates, they will focus on a different index. Since 2000 the Federal Reserve has used the personal-consumption-expenditures (PCE) price index, rather than the CPI, as its preferred measure of inflation. It is against this that the Fed’s target for inflation, 2%, is compared.

Weeks beforehand, at an annual gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Mr Powell had already more or less confirmed that a cut was imminent.

So have two draconian national-security laws, one imposed on the city by the central government in 2020 and another adopted by the local legislature this year.

In most rich countries annual core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has fallen from peaks of 5-8% to a more tolerable 3-5%. In defiance of pessimistic economists, there has been no accompanying economic slump. Growth varies from booming (America) to respectable (Australia, Canada, Japan) to tepid (Britain, the euro area), but nowhere has it collapsed.

Today that bet looks premature. Over the past three months core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, have risen at an annual rate of 4%, up from 2.6% in the three months to August. Producer prices have risen more than expected and consumers’ expectations of inflation over the next year have gone up, too.
